üöÄ Implementing a Robust VPN Solution for Secure Remote Access to Cloud Resources
üìñ Introduction

Organizations increasingly depend on cloud resources such as AWS EC2, RDS, and VPC services. With the rise of remote work, employees need secure access to cloud services from anywhere in the world.

Directly exposing resources to the internet introduces severe security risks (unauthorized access, sniffing, data breaches). To address this, a VPN solution provides secure and private connectivity between remote clients and cloud resources.

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN using AWS Client VPN with IAM authentication, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.

üéØ Motivation

Protect sensitive business data from cyberattacks and unauthorized access.

Provide remote teams with seamless and secure connectivity.

Eliminate risks of public-facing SSH/RDP connections.

Simplify management with IAM-based authentication.

Ensure the solution is scalable, robust, and easy to manage for future needs.

‚ö° Without VPN vs With VPN

Without VPN:

Data travels in plaintext over the internet.

Attackers can sniff/modify traffic.

No identity verification for users.

With VPN:

Data is encrypted (AES, IPsec).

Private tunnel ‚Äì only authenticated users connect.

Cloud resources hidden from direct internet exposure.

Strong authentication (Certificates, IAM, MFA).

üèóÔ∏è Solution Development
üîπ Architecture Chosen

Point-to-Site VPN ‚Üí Individual employees connect securely to AWS VPC.

Authentication & Key Management:

TLS Handshake with OpenVPN.

Diffie-Hellman for session key exchange.

Digital certificates for identity validation.

Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) ensures new keys for each session.

MFA support for stronger security.

üîß Implementation Steps
Step 1: Set Up VPC & Networking

VPC CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16

Subnets:

Public Subnet: 10.0.1.0/24

Private Subnet: 10.0.2.0/24

Internet Gateway: VPN-IGW

Route Tables:

Public RT ‚Üí IGW

Private RT ‚Üí NAT Gateway

Step 2: Launch OpenVPN Server

Create an EC2 instance using OpenVPN AMI.

Configure Admin UI and Client UI access.

Step 3: Connect to Admin UI

Login using credentials set during instance launch.

Step 4: Client Setup

Access Client UI and download connection profile.

Install OpenVPN Client on local device.

Import profile and connect securely.

Step 5: Test VPN Connection

Ping private IP of OpenVPN server (fails without VPN).

Connect via OpenVPN client ‚Üí authentication succeeds.

Ping again ‚Üí successful.

Step 6: Create Additional Resources

Deploy APP-SERVER EC2 in private subnet.

Configure NAT Gateway in public subnet.

Test communication through VPN.

Step 7: SSH & App Access

Connect securely to APP-SERVER via VPN.

Install and start Apache server:

sudo su
yum install httpd -y
systemctl start httpd
systemctl status httpd


Access Apache using private IP of APP-SERVER (while VPN is active).

‚úÖ Results

Remote users successfully connected to AWS private resources via VPN.

Apache server running inside private subnet accessed securely.

Communication tested using NAT Gateway and private IPs.

Data remained encrypted and accessible only via authenticated VPN clients.

üìù Conclusion

This project implemented a secure Point-to-Site VPN using AWS Client VPN and OpenVPN.

Key achievements:

Encrypted tunnels ensuring confidentiality & integrity.

IAM & certificate-based authentication for controlled access.

Scalable & flexible architecture with support for split/full tunnel modes.

Remote users can now securely manage cloud resources without exposing them to the public internet.
